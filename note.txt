currently configuring signup route

after signup, user is added to db but user session is null until
 user confirms email

i recommend adding a popup telling users to confirm their email
 and redirecting them to login page

im thinking of changing the followers table to link with auth.users
 instead of public (reason: users might follow or gain a follower
  before adding a username, causing inconsistencies)

n.a...@gmail.com is currently unconfirmed.
